# odin-landing-page

This project is an example of a landing page for a capsule hotel. This is my second project while going through the Odin Project curriculum. At this point, we learned more about CSS such as the box model, and Flexbox. In this project, those skills will be demonstrated.

# Skills

Skills I will have demonstrated once completed:

- Basic HTML, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project

- Basic CSS, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project along with:
